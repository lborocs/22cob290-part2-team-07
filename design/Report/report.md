# Introduction

The purpose of this report is to discuss and explain the system design and implementation strategy which have been applied to this system. The system which has been created is a productivity and knowledge management system. The system has been based off set requirements delivered to us via the “specification” letter from the client as well as ever changing requirements and clarifications discussed with the client via the online forums. The scope of this project is set within these requirements which were outlined in our requirements document. 

To create the system, we were aided by many different tools. GitHub provided the distributed version control of git, which allowed each of us to write code on our different machines. GitHub also provided us with a method of tracking jobs which needed to be done. This way, we could track the progression of the software and allocate/distribute everyone’s time fairly. We used Vue.js as a JavaScript framework to help us build the system. Vue.js gave us a multiplex of tools which could be used to build the front-end and make it interactive. We also used Nuxt which is a higher-level framework which builds on top of vue. Nuxt takes complexity away from development as it handles client-side and server-side processing. Therefore, as developers, we could focus on the actual programming. MySQL was also used as a database management system. The database stored information about the productivity and knowledge management system (e.g., tasks, account details etc). On top of MySQL, we used Prisma to help make development faster and more intuitive – through auto-completions and easy-to-read data models.
